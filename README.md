# Uber System Simulation
A comprehensive text-based simulation of an Uber-like application in Java.  
Handles ride pickups, driver assignment, deliveries, and route calculations on a 9Ã—9 city grid, showcasing data structures, OOP principles, exception handling, and file I/O.

## Features
- Register customers and drivers  
- Request and match both rides and deliveries  
- Grid-based city map with street/avenue coordinate parsing  
- Shortest-path calculation and distance estimation  
- Menu-driven command-line interface  
- File-based persistence for logs and records  
- Robust input validation and exception handling  

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher  
- A shell or terminal (bash, PowerShell, etc.)  

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/code-by-sahib/Uber-System-Simulation.git
   ```
2. **Enter the source directory**  
   ```bash
   cd Uber-System-Simulation/Code
   ```
3. **Compile all Java files**  
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

## Usage
1. **Launch the application**  
   ```bash
   java TMUberSystemManager
   ```
2. **Follow the on-screen menu** to:
   - Register new riders or drivers  
   - Request a ride or delivery  
   - View trip history and logs  
3. **Check output files** in the project root for persistence.
